      <para>
        The Haskell packages infrastructure has been re-designed from the ground up.
        NixOS now distributes the latest version of every single package registered on
        <link xlink:href="http://hackage.haskell.org/">Hackage</link>, i.e. well over
        8000 Haskell packages. Further information and usage instructions for the
        improved infrastructure are available at <link
        xlink:href="https://nixos.org/wiki/Haskell">https://nixos.org/wiki/Haskell</link>.
        Users migrating from an earlier release will find also find helpful information
        below, in the list of backwards-incompatible changes.

<para>When upgrading from a previous release, please be aware of the
following incompatible changes:

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>Steam now doesn't need root rights to work. Instead of using
<literal>*-steam-chrootenv</literal>, you should now just run <literal>steam</literal>.
<literal>steamChrootEnv</literal> package was renamed to <literal>steam</literal>,
and old <literal>steam</literal> package -- to <literal>steamOriginal</literal>.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>CMPlayer has been renamed to bomi upstream. Package <literal>cmplayer</literal>
was accordingly renamed to <literal>bomi</literal>
</para></listitem>

<listitem>
    <para>
        The default <literal>NIX_PATH</literal> for NixOS now includes
        <literal>/nix/var/nix/profiles/per-user/root/channels</literal>, so it's
        easy to add custom channels.
    </para>
    <para>
        Moreover, whenever a <command>nixos-rebuild &lt;action&gt;
        --upgrade</command> is issued, every channel that includes a file
        called <filename>.update-on-nixos-rebuild</filename> will be upgraded
        alongside of the <literal>nixos</literal> channel.
    </para>

  </para>
  <para>
